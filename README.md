# IBM-Data-Analyst-Practice-Projects
This repository represents my learning journey toward becoming a data analyst. Through hands-on practice projects inspired by IBM’s Data Analyst curriculum, I am developing job-ready skills required for entry-level data analyst roles.
I am strengthening my understanding of core data analysis concepts and gaining practical experience using tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and IBM Cognos Analytics.
These projects help me practice data cleaning, data manipulation, visualization, and applying analytical techniques to real-world datasets.
